% Accounts

% To get accounts functionality, add one or more of the following packages to your app with meteor add:

% accounts-ui: This package allows you to use {{> loginButtons}} in your templates to add an automatically generated UI that will let users log into your app. There are several community alternatives to this package that change the appearance, or you can not use it and use the advanced Accounts methods instead.
% accounts-password: This package will allow users to log in with passwords. When you add it the loginButtons dropdown will automatically gain email and password fields.
% accounts-facebook, accounts-google, accounts-github, accounts-twitter, and community packages for other services will allow your users to log in with their accounts from other websites. These will automatically add buttons to the loginButtons dropdown.

%The browser-policy family of packages, part of Webapp, lets you set security-related policies that will be enforced by newer browsers. These policies help you prevent and mitigate common attacks like cross-site scripting and clickjacking.
