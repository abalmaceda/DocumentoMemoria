% Abstract. The success of an e-commerce site is, in part, related to how easy it is
% to use. This research investigated whether advanced web metrics, calculated using
% Google Analytics software, could be used to evaluate the overall usability
% of e-commerce sites, and also to identify potential usability problem areas. Web
% metric data are easy to collect but analysis and interpretation are timeconsuming.
% E-commerce site managers therefore need to be sure that employing
% web analytics can effectively improve the usability of their websites. The research
% suggested specific web metrics that are useful for quickly indicating
% general usability problem areas and specific pages in an e-commerce site that
% have usability problems. However, what they cannot do is provide in-depth detail
% about specific problems that might be present on a page. 


Hay una considerable evidencia que decisiones basadas en \analytics tienen más probabilidad de resultar correctas que aquellas basadas en la intuición. Es, al menos, mejor saber dentro de los limites de datos y análisis que \textit{creer}, \textit{pensar} o \textit{sentir}, y la mayoría de las compañias pueden beneficiarse desde desciones tomadas analíticamente. Claramente, existen circuntancias en las cuales las desiciones no pueden o no deberían realiarse analíticamente \cite{davenport2007competing}.
%There is considerable evidence that decisions based on analytics are more likely to be correct than those based on intuition.9 It’s better to know—at least within the limits of data and analysis—than to believe or think or feel, and most companies can benefit from more analytical decision making. Of course, there are some circumstances in which decisions can’t or shouldn’t be based on analytics. Some of these circumstances are described in Malcolm Gladwell’s popular book Blink, which is a paean to intuitive decision making.





% Why You Need Google Analytics

% If you owned a physical storefront, you have the ability to see you customer. You can view their habits firsthand and speak with them. Without ecommerce analytics, an online store leaves you blind to much information about your visitors and customers you would ordinarily get to see.

% Using Google Analytics can better help you understand the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, better understand your visitors and optimize your store for conversions and sales.
