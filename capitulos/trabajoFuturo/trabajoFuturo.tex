Recommend related products
A great way to increase sales is by suggesting relevant or related products during the checkout process. For example, if you have a product that works better with a complementary item, be sure to include a link to it. A customer may not realize he needs the item until it's offered to him, and it certainly doesn't hurt to make a few friendly suggestions.

Don't require registration to complete checkout
Nothing irks a customer more than being forced to create an account in order to buy something online. After all, online shopping is supposed to be easy. Sure, having an account will make future purchases easier, but it does nothing for the situation at hand. Instead, give shoppers the option of creating an account once the transaction is complete.

Include product ratings and testimonials
One of the best ways to show customers that your products are worth their while is by including ratings and testimonials in product descriptions. Someone who is initially on the fence about adding an item to their cart may be swayed after seeing positive reviews and ratings.
